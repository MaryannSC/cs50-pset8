                        <h4>What are the different types of tea?</h4>
                            <p>There are four main kinds of teas (not including herbal teas): white, green, oolong, and black. These four types are made from the leaves of the
                               evergreen shrub, Camellia sinensis, but are processed differently.
                            </p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>
                                    White tea is the least processed form of tea from the Camellia sinensis plant, providing a more delicate flavor and contains less caffeine
                                    than black tea. For white tea, the leaves are harvested while they are still covered in silvery white hairs.
                                </li>
                                <li>Fresh green tea leaves are steamed, which preserves the polyphenols, a class of phytochemicals with strong antioxidant benefits. Green tea
                                    contains a small amount of caffeine, similar to that of white tea, ranging from 25 to 35 mg per cup.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    Oolong tea is derived from partially fermented tea leaves and contains similar amounts of caffeine as white and green tea. Oolong tea, though
                                    less popular, provides many of the same benefits as the more well-researched green tea.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    Black tea is the most processed of the tea leaves, but this allows the polyphenols to offer unique benefits. Black tea contains more caffeine
                                    than any other teas made from the Camellia sinensis plant.
                                </li>
                            </ul>
